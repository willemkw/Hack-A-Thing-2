### GameMaker Studio 2 Networking (Willem)
* **Tutorial:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbsXRuNijlo&list=LL3fbMUqUWMfwRZiROJgHEmQ&index=6&t=6s
* **Software:** Gamemaker Studio 2
* **Description:** Created a server and client that display players, allow them to click to move themselves around, and allow for chatting.
* **What I learned:** Having actually learned the skills required to use this game engine, doing things like networking isn't actually so hard as long as you're careful about how you go about it. The main barrier is that the engine is expensive to use, which may block us from using it altogether.
* **What didn't work:** Following the tutorial went fine. The main problem is getting licenses together for the group. We'll have to discuss this.
